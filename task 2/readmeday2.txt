# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective  
Perform EDA to understand patterns, trends, and feature relationships using **statistics** and **visualizations**.  

## 🛠 Tools  
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation & summary statistics  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Static plots (histograms, boxplots, pairplots)  
- **Plotly** → Interactive visualizations  

## ✅ Performed Tasks  
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)  
- Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features  
- Used pairplot and correlation matrix to analyze feature relationships  
- Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data  
- Made basic feature-level inferences from visuals  

## ▶️ How to Run
