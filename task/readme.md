Data Preprocessing and Cleaning Guide
Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data preprocessing workflow. The goal is to clean and prepare a dataset for further analysis or machine learning modeling. The main steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalizing numerical features, and removing outliers.

Steps Performed
1. Import and Explore Dataset

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Explored the first few rows with head().

Checked data types and missing values using info() and isnull().sum().

Generated basic statistics using describe().

2. Handle Missing Values

For numerical features, missing values were replaced with the median (or mean as an alternative).

For categorical features, missing values were replaced with the mode (most frequent value).

3. Encode Categorical Features

Converted categorical variables into numerical values using one-hot encoding.

This allows machine learning models to process categorical data effectively.

4. Normalize/Standardize Numerical Features

Used StandardScaler to standardize numerical features (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).

This ensures all features contribute equally to model training.

5. Detect and Remove Outliers

Visualized outliers using boxplots.

Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove extreme values.

Helps in reducing noise and improving model performance.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn (StandardScaler)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualization)
